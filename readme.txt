Wireless Quiz Buzzer System using Arduino and nRF24L01!
-------------------------------------------------------

This is a wireless quiz buzzer system to help work out who answered first when running a quiz.
It can also offer further attempts to anyone who hasn't previously answered!

Tip: If you have any problems with the DFPlayerMini, power it from the Arduino's 3.3v pin rather than 5v.
Also, if you have issues with the buttons connecting to the controller, power everything off, then power up the controller first for a few seconds.
